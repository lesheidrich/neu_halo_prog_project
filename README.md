# Honda Sales Price Prediction w/ Neural Network

The project was completed as a part of the Neural Network course at Eszterhazy Karoly Catholic University during my Computer Science BSc in 2023

## Project Description
As an introduction to Neural Networks, the project only utilizes Numpy and Pandas throughout the process of acquiring, cleaning, preparing and processing the data.

## Components
### dataset
This package contains the original and modified datasets of the Honda sales data. 

### src
The NN ops dir utilizes data_processor.py to clean and prepare the data with classic normalization and one-hot encoding.
